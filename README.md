# QuizApp


Project Overview
The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of my choice.


This project was about combining various ideas and skills Iâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course on Udacity.com. They include:

  - Planning your app design and navigation before coding.
  - Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
  - Creating, positioning, and styling views.
  - Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
  - Commenting and documenting my code.


### Installation

NewsApp requires [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) v 3.6.3 to run.
